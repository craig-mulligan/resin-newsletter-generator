### To make a newsletter:

1. Populate `data.json` with new content:
  * `articles` are "tier one" news features
  * `additionalLinks` are "tier two" news links on the last card

2. Add any images to `/img` folder.

3. `npm install && gulp build`

4. In `/build` you'll find a zip file. Upload this to mailchimp templates.
